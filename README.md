# 🎯 Census Income Classification

Predict whether an individual earns >\$50K/year using demographic and work-related data, powered by Logistic Regression.

---

## 📌 Overview
This project uses the **UCI Adult Income dataset** to train, evaluate, and deploy a machine learning model as a web application.

---

## 🚀 Features
✅ End-to-end ML pipeline (data ingestion → transformation → training → prediction)  
✅ Flask web app for real-time predictions  
✅ Modular, production-ready codebase  
✅ Docker support for deployment  
✅ Artifacts & logs for traceability

## 📊 Dataset

* [UCI Adult Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult)
* Features: age, education, marital status, occupation, hours-per-week, etc.

---

## 📈 Results

| Metric     | Value               |
| ---------- | ------------------- |
| Best Model | Logistic Regression |
| Accuracy   | 83.16%              |

---

## 📖 Key Insights

* Education and occupation significantly impact income level.
* Model can help in policy decisions, HR processes, and demographic analysis.

This is an End to End Machine Learning project on Logistic Regression

Dataset: Census-Income-Data

Traget feature: predict whether the individual annual income is <50k or >50k, based on the details given

features:
- age: continuous.
- workclass: Private, Self-emp-not-inc, Self-emp-inc, Federal-gov, Local-gov, State-gov, Without-pay, Never-worked.
- fnlwgt: continuous.
- education: Bachelors, Some-college, 11th, HS-grad, Prof-school, Assoc-acdm, Assoc-voc, 9th, 7th-8th, 12th, Masters, 1st-4th, 10th,    Doctorate, 5th-6th, Preschool.
- education-num: continuous.
- marital-status: Married-civ-spouse, Divorced, Never-married, Separated, Widowed, Married-spouse-absent, Married-AF-spouse.
- occupation: Tech-support, Craft-repair, Other-service, Sales, Exec-managerial, Prof-specialty, Handlers-cleaners, Machine-op-inspct, Adm-clerical, Farming-fishing, Transport-moving, Priv-house-serv, Protective-serv, Armed-Forces.
- relationship: Wife, Own-child, Husband, Not-in-family, Other-relative, Unmarried.

Target:
- class: >50K, <=50K

Model: LogisticRegression

Final parameters after hyperparametertuning:

{'C': 100, 'max_iter': 1000, 'penalty': 'l2', 'solver': 'saga'}

accuracy_score  = 0.79
roc_auc_score = 0.886

confusion_matrix = array([[9699, 2548],
                         [ 700, 3154]])

TP = 9699
FP = 2548
FN = 700
TN = 3154

Here <=50k is Positive and >50k is Negative

For Our dataset, False-Negatives should be decreased,
If a person is falsely predicted that he belong to a >50k data group, He may receive less
resources than what he should recieve actually, as he belongs to low income group.

So We should try to reduce False-Negatives
So recall will be our main performance metric.

Recall = TP/(TP+FN) = 0.932
